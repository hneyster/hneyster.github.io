I am a Gund Postdoctoral Fellow a at the University of Vermont, where I work with [Rachelle Gould](https://gouldgroup.weebly.com) and [Brian Beckage](https://brianbeckage.github.io/). <!--- If you know of any open positions, [please contact me](mailto:haroldeyster@gmail.com). -->

<!--- Human lifestyles are evolving. We're living in cities and relying on new technologies. We're interacting with friends and family differently, and working and playing differently. All of these changes are reshaping the relationships that we build with nature. Unfortunately, conservation efforts often fail to harness these new relationships, stifling ordinary people's conservation action. -->

I investigate relationships among birds, people, trees, cities, and climate, and seek to [understand](/research) how to reorient these relationships towards sustainable pathways. I believe that integrating tools, methods, and approaches from many different disciplines is essential to understanding these relationships; I draw on a range of methods from ecology, sociology, psychology, anthropology, climate science, and others. <!-- use a transdisciplinary approach 
I investigate environmental issues through a relational lens:  at the center of conservation challenges are humanâ€“nature relationships. Using a transdisciplinary approach that draws on methods from ecology, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics, [I study](/research) how to marshal today's salient human-nature relationships to enable more sustainable trajectories. -->

I bring my joy for birding, painting, Bayesian inference, and outdoor adventure into my research as much as possible, though I have yet to figure out a way of incorporating my enthusiasm for sourdough baking.

## News

The first paper from my postdoc is now out! Brian Beckage and I show how coniferous trees may be key for ameliorating heat waves in the Pacific Northwest.  [Summary twitter thread](https://twitter.com/HaroldEyster/status/1528749939647553538).

The first papers are now out from my PhD! The first on using genetic information and recognition of interdependent relationships with nature to motivate the conservation of widespread species. [Summary twitter thread](https://twitter.com/HaroldEyster/status/1482037800098840589).

The second paper combines a whole bunch of biophysical metrics to show that woody perennial polyculture farms in the US enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services relative to traditional farms. [Summary twitter thread](https://twitter.com/HaroldEyster/status/1480549083358105601).

In Summer 2021 I completed my [PhD](https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0401270) at the University of British Columbia with [Dr. Kai Chan](https://chanslab.ires.ubc.ca/). Before coming to UBC, I received a BA from Harvard University in Environmental Science and Public Policy.

I also bird color vision and how relationships between birds and plants create colors with [Dr. Mary Caswell Stoddard](https://www.marycstoddard.com/).
