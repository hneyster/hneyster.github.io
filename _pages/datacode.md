I believe that freely sharing data (except when containing personal information) and code is essential to advance research. I hope my data and code can be useful to other researchers. 

Most of the data and code underlying my papers can be found on the Open Science Foundation: [https://osf.io/mx9v6/](https://osf.io/mx9v6/)

I also have data and code on my Github page:  [https://github.com/hneyster/][https://github.com/hneyster/], on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.34tmpg4nt), and on Figshare, including perennial polyculture [biophyscal data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5645281.v2), and bird [relfectance data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7235831.v1).
